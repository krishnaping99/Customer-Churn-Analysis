# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Overview

This Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing Customer Churn in a banking dataset using Power BI as the primary analytical and visualizing tool. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition is of paramount importance to businesses, enabling them to implement effective strategies to retain their customer base. Throughout this project, we will delve into the dataset, undertake data transformation and cleansing, construct data models, scrutinize customer behavior, and present our findings visually through Power BI.

## Learning Objectives

* Gain a solid understanding of what customer churn is and why it's critical for businesses, extract actionable business insights and recommend strategies for reducing churn.
* Learn how to clean and preprocess raw data, including handling missing values, duplicates, and optimizing data for analysis.
* Explore data modeling techniques such as creating cardinalities, establishing relationships between tables, and implementing star schema structures.
* Master advanced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions for performing complex calculations and aggregations.
* Learn how to create calculated measures to derive meaningful insights and metrics from the dataset.
* Understand how to add data slicers and filters for interactive data exploration and visualization.
* Discover how to integrate Q & A AI visuals for natural language-driven insights and queries.
* Learn how to apply row-level security to restrict data access based on user roles and geographical location.
* Explore various data visualization techniques, including clustered bar graphs, column charts, donut charts, line graphs, matrices, and AI Smart narratives.
* Gain hands-on experience in building interactive dashboards and reports to communicate data-driven findings effectively.
