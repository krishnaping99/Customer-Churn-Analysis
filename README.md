# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing Customer Churn in a banking dataset using Power BI as the primary analytical and visualizing tool. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition is of paramount importance to businesses, enabling them to implement effective strategies to retain their customer base. Throughout this project, we will delve into the dataset, undertake data transformation and cleansing, construct data models, scrutinize customer behavior, and present our findings visually through Power BI.

## Project Objectives

* Cleaning and preprocess raw data, including handling missing values, duplicates, and optimizing data for analysis.
* Implemented data modeling techniques such as creating cardinalities, establishing relationships between tables, and implementing star schema structures.
* Advanced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions were applied for performing complex calculations and aggregations.
* Created calculated measures to derive meaningful insights and metrics from the dataset.
* Utilized data slicers and filters to facilitate interactive data exploration and enhance visualization capabilities.
* Integrated Q & A AI visuals for natural language-driven insights and queries.
* Applied row-level security to restrict data access based on user roles and geographical location.
* Multiple data visualization techniques were implemented, including clustered bar graphs, column charts, donut charts, line graphs, matrices, and AI Smart narratives.
* Built interactive dashboards and reports to communicate data-driven findings effectively.

## Tools Used

**Microsoft Power BI** was used for data analysis and data visualization.

## Key Concepts

Four main key concepts were tackled in this project i.e Data Transformation, Data Modelling, Data Analysis and Data Visualizations. Brief details of each key concept are as follows:

## Data Transformation
### Data Cleaning:
The dataset undergoes thorough data cleaning, including the removal of null values and the optimization of rows/columns.

### Date Master Table:
A Date Master table is created using DAX Calendar functions and sub-functions like DAX month and year to facilitate time-based analysis.

## Data Modelling
### Power Pivot:
Power Pivot is employed to establish cardinalities and relationships between tables, ensuring data coherence and enabling efficient querying.

### Star Schema:
A star schema is implemented for optimal data modeling, enhancing data retrieval speed and simplifying complex queries.

## Data Analysis
### Calculations Table:
A dedicated "Calculations" table is generated to store essential measures and calculated values for in-depth analysis.

### DAX Functions:
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions are utilized for data analysis, with a specific focus on credit type-related calculations.

### Row Level Security:
Row Level Security is implemented by creating roles based on geographical location, ensuring data access control.

## Data Visualization
### Interactive Dashboards:
Interactive dashboards and reports are crafted using Power BI's visualization techniques to offer a comprehensive view of the data.

### Power BI Visualizations:
Various Power BI visualizations are employed, including clustered bar graphs, column charts, donut charts, line graphs, matrices, Q & A AI visuals, and AI Smart narratives.

### Q&A AI Visuals:
Q & A AI visuals are integrated to enable users to ask natural language questions and receive insights directly from the data.

### Data Slicers:
Filters for data slicers are added to empower users to interactively explore and filter the data.

## Usage
